> What is TechOdyssey?

TechOdyssey is a month-long event where tasks on each of the eight domains are uploaded weekly. You can work on one or more domains of your choice. The tasks will be interrelated with the previous weeks' tasks and will increase in difficulty. Tutorial videos will be uploaded at the end of the week.
<br></br>

> How do I participate?

Tasks will be posted every Monday on GitHub (repository link & resources on how to use GitHub will be shared) and you will have to upload your solutions by each Sunday on Github and share the link along with your contact details on a separate Google Form. Every valid submission will add up to the leaderboard.
<br></br>

> Why should I participate?

By the end of the event, you will gain an intermediate level of knowledge in various domains, which will be useful if you plan to attend our flagship Devdays workshop in the upcoming even semester.
You also stand a chance to win exciting swags and directly become a core team member of team DCS!
