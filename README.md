> What is TechOdyssey?

TechOdyssey is a month-long event where tasks on each of the eight domains are uploaded weekly. You can work on one or more domains of your choice. The tasks will be interrelated with the previous weeks' tasks and will increase in difficulty. Tutorial videos will be uploaded at the end of the week.
